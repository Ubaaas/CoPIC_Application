CoPIC: MOBILE-BASED ROASTED COFFEE BEANS DEFECT CLASSIFICATION USING IMAGE PROCESSING

The main objective of this project is to implement a convolutional neural network model in a mobile application that is capable of classifying defects using smartphones

Specifically, this study aims:
1. To deploy MobileNETV2 for detecting coffee bean defects in a mobile application with a custom framework for development visualization.
2. To create a network framework for the implementation of a mobile application to a cloud-based repository.
3. To utilize ISO/IEC 25010 in a mobile application to test the following: </br>
  a. Functional Suitability</br>
  b. Reliability</br>
  c. Usability</br>
